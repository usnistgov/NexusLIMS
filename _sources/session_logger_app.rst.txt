Session logging
===============

    `Last updated: March 7, 2020`

To accurately know what files should be included in each Experiment's record,
it is important to have a timestamp for the beginning `and` end of when a user
has collected data. To facilitate collecting this information, a small
application has been written that is run from the microscope support (or
control) PC and logs basic session information to the
:doc:`NexusLIMS database <database>`. This document explains how this
application is used, its design, what information it collects, and how it is
deployed to the individual microscopes.

How to use the logger app
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Using the Session Logger application is very simple. On each Nexus Facility
microscope, there will be a shortcut on the desktop that points to the
application that has been stored within a local directory on the computer. At
the beginning of an Experiment, double click on the following icon to start a
session:

..  figure:: _static/logger_icon.png
    :width: 15%
    :align: center
    :alt: Session Logger application shortcut icon
    :figclass: align-center


After a short delay (about 5 seconds, depending on the microscope), the
application will launch and perform a number of steps (described
`below <actions_>`_), resulting in a display informing the user that a session
has been started:

..  figure:: _static/logger_in_action.png
    :align: center
    :width: 30%
    :alt: Session Logger application in action
    :figclass: align-center

Once this screen is displayed, the user should simply keep the window open
while they work (it can be minimized with no problem). The logger does not
perform any actions during this stage, and is simply waiting for the user to
click the `"End Session"` button.

Once the user has finished collecting data, they should click the large
`"End Session"` button in the application. This will trigger the application
to mark the current Experiment as finished in the :doc:`database <database>`,
and the logger application will close itself after a short delay.

What if something goes wrong?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the unlikely event that the logger application encounters an unexpected
condition in the database or other error, it will inform the user and pop-up
a debugging log with more information (this log can also always be accessed
by clicking the `"Show debug log"` button on the main screen):

..  figure:: _static/logger_log.png
    :align: center
    :width: 40%
    :alt: Session Logger debugging log window
    :figclass: align-center

If this log window appears on its own (which it shouldn't), we ask that that
you click the `"Copy"` button to copy all the text to the clipboard and send it
to `miclims@nist.gov <mailto:miclims@nist.gov>`_ so the NexusLIMS developers
can resolve the issue.

.. _interrupted:

Interrupted sessions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The session logger application does it's best to ensure that if the window is
closed by any means, it sends an `"End Session"` log to the
:doc:`database <database>`. There is an option to "Pause Session" however,
which is prompted if the regular "Close window" button is clicked:

..  figure:: _static/logger_pause_session.png
    :align: center
    :width: 50%
    :alt: Session Logger pause session option
    :figclass: align-center

Clicking `"Pause session"` will immediately close the application without
sending any further information to the database, and should only be done if the
user plans to resume the session before another user will use the instrument
(e.g. they need to restart the computer for some reason). Pausing the session
will leave the database in an inconsistent state, which will be detected the
next time the logger application is run. If this is the case, the user will be
prompted to confirm whether they want to continue the existing session, or
start a new one:

..  figure:: _static/logger_resume_session.png
    :align: center
    :width: 40%
    :alt: Session Logger pause session option
    :figclass: align-center

This dialog will also appear when the user clicks on the desktop shortcut
in the event the computer crashed for some reason and the application was
forcibly closed. Clicking `"Continue"` will cause the application to use the
existing session (found in the database), while clicking `"New session"` will
end the session that was found and start a new one.

.. _actions:

Actions performed by the logger
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The NexusLIMS Session Logger performs a number of steps to record that an
Experiment has occurred, and keeps the progress bar up to date while it is
operating. These steps are detailed below.

.. _step-1:

1. Mounting the network share
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first action performed by the logger is to "ping" the central file server
where data is saved and the NexusLIMS database is stored. Based on the
response, the logger stores the IP address of this server (to avoid problems
with the DNS server). The logger then looks at the currently mounted drives on
the microscope computer and picks a drive letter that is not in use. With this
information, the program runs a Windows command to mount the drive, such as:

..  code-block:: bat

    net use H: \\129.6.16.126\63internal\nexuslims

After this command finishes, the logger confirms that it can access the
database file as expected, and raises an error if not.

2. Getting the instrument name
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using the database file on the mounted drive, the logger application queries
the ``instruments`` table in the database using the `"hostname"` of the current
computer. In this way, a computer name (such as ``TITAN52331880``) gets mapped
to an instrument persistent identifier (PID) (such as ``FEI-Titan-TEM-635816``)
and this value is stored for later use.

3. Checking instrument status
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before logging the start of a new Experiment, first the logger application
checks to ensure that the most recent entry logged for this instrument was
an ``'END'`` entry, meaning that the last session was marked as finished.
For example, the code runs a query such as the following to get the most
recent entry (that was not a record generation event):

..  code-block:: sql

    SELECT event_type, session_identifier, id_session_log, timestamp
    FROM session_log WHERE instrument = 'FEI-Titan-TEM-635816'
    AND NOT event_type = 'RECORD_GENERATION'
    ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1;

If this most recent entry is an ``'END'``, the database is in its expected
normal state, and the application continues on as normal. If it is instead a
``'START'`` entry, then the application asks the user
whether they want to continue the existing session found in the database, or
start a new one (see the `interrupted session <interrupted_>`_ section for more
details). If the user chooses to continue the existing session, the logger
application notes the session identifier from the database for that session and
jumps to `step 6 <step-6_>`_.

.. _step-4:

4. Inserting a ``START`` log
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With the instrument PID known and a randomly generated identifier string, the
logger runs a database insertion query on the ``session_log`` table to record
that a session has been started. While not explicitly specified in the query,
the current timestamp is also included in the insertion. As an example:

..  code-block:: sql

    INSERT INTO session_log (instrument, event_type,
                             session_identifier, user)
    VALUES ('FEI-Titan-TEM-635816', 'START',
            'c9b774c9-4a59-4154-af05-0e2477e57cc4', 'local_user');

After this has finished, the logger runs another query to verify that the row
was inserted into the database as expected, and raises an error if not.

5. Unmounting the network share
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After the session start log has been added, the network share created in step 1
is unmounted to clean up while the logger application waits for the next
action. While the application is waiting, it simply sits idle until the
`"End session"` button is pressed.

.. _step-6:

6. Ending the session
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the user clicks the `"End session"` button, the logger application again
mounts the network share (as in `step 1 <step-1_>`_) so it can communicate with
the :doc:`NexusLIMS database <database>`. Using the same `session identifier`
value as before, the application inserts a corresponding ``'END'`` log into the
database using a query very similar to that in `step 4 <step-4_>`_.
After verifying that this record was inserted correctly, the application
then updates the status of both the ``'START'`` and ``'END'`` logs for this
session from ``'WAITING_FOR_END'`` to ``'TO_BE_BUILT'``. This status indicates
to the :doc:`record builder <record_building>` that it should go ahead to
actually build and upload the record for this Experiment.

7. Cleaning up
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After updating the logs in the previous step, the logger application unmounts
the network share (as before), and if everything went according to plan,
waits three seconds and then shuts itself down. At this point, it is ready
to be run again by the next user that arrives to begin a new session.

Information collected
+++++++++++++++++++++

As described above and in the database :doc:`documentation <database>`, the
logger application collects the bare minimum amount of information required
to compile an Experiment's record. The values collected from the microscope
computer that are recorded to the database with each log are:

+------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
|        Variable        |                   Description                    |
+========================+==================================================+
| ``session_identifier`` | A random UUID4 (36-character string) that        |
|                        | is consistent among the record's                 |
|                        | record's ``"START"``, ``"END"``, and             |
|                        | ``"RECORD_GENERATION"`` events.                  |
+------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| ``instrument``         | The instrument PID associated with               |
|                        | this microscope's computer                       |
+------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| ``timestamp``          | The current date and time (in local time)        |
+------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| ``event_type``         | The type of log for this session (either         |
|                        | ``"START"`` for the beginning of an Experiment,  |
|                        | or ``"END"`` for the end of one).                |
+------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| ``record_status``      | The status of the record                         |
|                        | associated with this session.                    |
|                        | Its value is ``"WAITING_FOR_END"`` at first, but |
|                        | is updated to ``"TO_BE_BUILT"`` after the        |
|                        | session has ended.                               |
+------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| ``user``               | The username of the currently logged in user     |
|                        | (often this is just ``supervisor`` or ``admin``) |
+------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+


Logger implementation and deployment
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

As :doc:`data security <data_security>` is of the utmost importance in
NexusLIMS, the developers felt it prudent to describe in detail the specific
implementation that was used to produce the session logger application that
runs on the microscope PCs (since these machines control critical
instrumentation).

The logger application is implemented in two files: |dbloggerLink|_ (that
contains the interactive GUI parts of the code) and |makedbentryLink|_ (that
contains the database communication and logic code).

The application is written using 32-bit Python 3.4.4 (in order to support
computers back to Windows XP) and is compiled to a single .exe file using the
|PyInstaller|_ package for simple deployment. The executable is built by using
the |specfileLink|_ file and running:

..  code-block:: bash

    pyinstaller.exe db_logger_gui.spec

The logger application is compiled to ``NexusLIMS Session Logger.exe``, and this
file is then copied to the centralized file storage at
``//cfs2e.nist.gov/63internal/mmfnexus/NexusLIMS/NexusLIMS Session Logger.exe``,
where it is then pulled down to the individual microscope PCs by the startup
batch script that is used to mount the centralized file storage. Each Nexus
microscope has a desktop shortcut that points to this copied file, so users are
able to launch the latest version of the logger application each time they
click the icon.

The application runs as a
`portable executable <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Executable>`_,
meaning it does not get "installed" onto the computer running it in the
traditional sense, and leaves nothing behind in the Windows registry or on the
filesystem. It also runs without administrator privileges. The app extracts a
minimal Python runtime to a temporary folder, which is removed when the
application is closed (on Windows XP machines, this is usually in the
``C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\Local Settings\Temp\_MEI#####``
folder, where ``#####`` is a random number). This step is the reason for
the small delay when first starting the logger.

The session logging app is written mostly using "pure" Python (meaning
it primarily utilizes built-in modules). The GUI portions are written using
the `TkInter <https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter>`_ library, while the
database communication uses the
`sqlite3 <https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html>`_ library. A few
`Windows`-specific parts of the code are used to find an unused drive letter
to mount the central file network share using the
`ctypes <https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/ctypes.html>`_ module.

System calls
^^^^^^^^^^^^

While most of the logger application's logic is implemented in the Python code,
a few operations require interfacing directly with the microscope computer
via `Windows` command line operations.
These commands are run using the
`subprocess <https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/subprocess.html>`_ module, and
are explained here so Nexus microscope operators have a reference for every
command that is run on their machines:

- The first two system calls are used by the GUI code (|dbloggerLink|_)
  and query the local system to get the current
  monitor resolution and display DPI, so the logger application can be reliably
  placed in the center of the screen::

      wmic path Win32_VideoController get CurrentHorizontalResolution, CurrentVerticalResolution

  This command uses the
  `Windows Management Instrumentation command-line (WMIC) utility <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/wmic>`_
  (in read-only mode) to get the current screen width and height in pixels.
  The next command is::

      reg query "HKCU\Control Panel\Desktop\WindowMetrics" /v AppliedDPI

  This command queries (again, read-only) the Windows registry to get the display
  "scaling factor", which affects how wide windows are by default. The output
  of these last two commands is used to calculate the correct placement to
  ensure the GUI window opens in the center of the screen.

- The next system call is used by the database communication module
  (|makedbentryLink|_) to get the IP address of the central file system where
  the database file is stored (``//cfs2e.nist.gov/``), since mounting via IP is
  more reliable than using the host name. The command used for this is::

      ping cfs2e.nist.gov -n 1

  This command will send a single ping to the server and resolve the host name
  to an IP address. The output of the command is parsed to find the IP that
  should be used to mount the network location.

- Next, the |makedbentryLink|_ module runs::

      net use

  to list the currently mounted network drives. If the required network location
  (``//cfs2e.nist.gov/63internal/nexusLIMS``) is already mounted, that drive
  path is used rather than mounting another copy. If it is not, the path will
  be mounted using a command::

      net use H: \\cfs2e.nist.gov\63internal\nexusLIMS

  The drive letter (in this example ``H:``) is automatically determined by
  finding a currently unused drive letter earlier in the code.

- Finally, when the database operations have finished, the code runs one final
  system call::

      net use H: /del /y

  which simply unmounts the network drive that was used earlier to connect to
  the database.
