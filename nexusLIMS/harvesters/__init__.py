class ReservationEvent:
    """
    A representation of a single calendar reservation, independent of the type
    of calendar the reservation was made with. ``ReservationEvent``
    is a common interface that is used by the record building code.
    Any attribute can be None to indicate it was not present or no value was
    provided. The :py:meth:`as_xml` method is used to serialize the information
    contained within a ``ReservationEvent`` into an XML representation that is
    compatible with the Nexus Facility ``Experiment`` schema.

    Attributes
    ----------
    experiment_title
        The title of the event
    instrument
        The instrument associated with this reservation
    last_updated : datetime.datetime
        The time this event was last updated
    username
        The username of the user indicated in this event
    user_full_name
        The full name of the user for this event
    created_by
        The username of the user that created this event
    created_by_full_name

    end_time
        The time this event was scheduled to end
    reservation_type
        The "type" or category of this event (such as User session, service,
        etc.))
    experiment_purpose
        The user-entered purpose of this experiment
    sample_details
        A list of the user-entered sample details for this experiment. The
        length of the list must match that given in ``sample_pid`` and
        ``sample_name``.
    sample_pid
        A list of sample PIDs provided by the user. The
        length of the list must match that given in ``sample_details`` and
        ``sample_name``.
    sample_name
        A list of user-friendly sample names (not a PID). The
        length of the list must match that given in ``sample_details`` and

        A list of the user-entered project names for this experiment. The
        length of the list must match that given in ``project_id`` and
        ``project_ref``.

        A list of the specific project IDs within a research group/division. The
        length of the list must match that given in ``project_name`` and
        ``project_ref``.
    project_ref
        A list of (optional) links to this project in another database. The

        ``project_id``.
    internal_id
        The identifier assigned to this event (if any) by the calendaring system

        An identifier of the group this experiment was performed for (i.e.
        the user's group)
